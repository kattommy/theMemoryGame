I chose my field of study because I would like to work with people, even though my physic's teacher said that I should choose a technical field. 
When I was working as a dietitian, I realized that I want to work with people, but I need to be a part of a team.
Because of these two reasons, I started to learn to programming, and I really enjoy of it. Next step is to find a great job and check it out. :)
